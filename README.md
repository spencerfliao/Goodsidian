# Goodsidian

Goodsidian is a tool designed to transform the books from your Goodreads shelves into neatly formatted notes in Obsidian, allowing you to showcase, collect, and annotate them in your desired style.
This project draws inspiration from Joschua's original implementation, which can be found at Joschua's Goodsidian. Unfortunately, I encountered issues with the bash code provided and was unable to execute it. So I developed my own version in Python.

I hope this tool proves valuable to fellow enthusiasts of reading, note-taking, and collecting.

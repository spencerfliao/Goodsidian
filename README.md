# Goodsidian

Goodsidian takes books on your Goodreads shelves and formats them to notes in Obsidian so that you could showcase, collect, and annotate them in your desired style.

This project draws inspiration from Joschua's https://github.com/selfire1/goodsidian Unfortunately, I encountered issues with the bash code provided and was unable to execute it. So I developed my own version in Python.

I hope this tool proves valuable to fellow enthusiasts of reading, note-taking, and collecting.

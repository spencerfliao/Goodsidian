# Goodsidian
Goodsidian takes books on your Goodreads shelves and formats them to notes in Obsidian so that you could showcase/collect/notate them the way you want.
This project was inspired by Joschua's https://github.com/selfire1/goodsidian
I couldn't get the bash code to run though, so I wrote my own python version of it. Hope it can benefit anyone who loves reading, note-making, and hoarding as much as I do.
